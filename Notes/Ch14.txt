tow categories of testing: 1) unit testing 2) property testing

unit testing tests the smalles atomic units of software independently of one 
another.

spec testing is a newer version of unit testing. it tests specific functions 
independently and asks you to assert that when given the declared input, the 
result of the operation will be equal to the desired result.

spec vs unit: spec is written in terms of assertions that are in human-readable 
lang.

property tests test the formal properties of programs wo requiring formal proofs 
by allowing you to express a truth-valued, universally quantified function, which 
will then be checked against randomly generated inputs.
