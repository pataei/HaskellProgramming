* list comprehension: [outputList | inputList, predicate]

* prelude multiple line code:
  :{ blah
  :}

* spine: the connective structure that ties the collection of values together.
* nonstrict eval: the list isn't constructed untile it's consumed, nothing is evaluated until it must be.
* sprint command: prints variables and you can see what has been evaluated already, with the underscore representing expressions that haven't been evaluated.
* normal form: expressions are fully evaluated.
* weak head normal form: expressions are only evaluated as far as is necessary to reach a data constructor.
